# Hi I'm Fodé
🔧 Passionate about solving problems and understanding the "why" behind each challenge<br>
📦 Organization is my foundation - I love transforming chaos into structure<br>
🎓 Currently in the Common Core at 42 School - always learning and evolving<br>

```c
int main(void)
{
    const char *FMancaDev = "always learning";
    bool looping = true;

    while (looping)
    {
        printf("I'm %s — and this loop never stops!\n", FMancaDev);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
## 🔍 About Me
I’m a programming **student** at **42Porto**, learning to code from scratch and exploring the problem-solving mindset that programming demands.
I love the process of breaking down problems, experimenting, failing, and eventually arriving at clean, functional solutions.
This GitHub is a record of my growth as a developer, storing projects, experiments, and coding adventures.
